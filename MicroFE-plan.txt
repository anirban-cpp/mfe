#   Set up Git monorepo which will contain all our individual micro FEs.
    This can be done easily with turbo: "npx create-turbo@latest -e with-react-native-web"
    Link: https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/with-react-native-web

#   Repo will have packages folder. This will have container (which is our main host app)
    Along with that we will have our individual microFEs and shared (state/store).
    Also we can additionally have UI package that may contain any component/sharable code
    from external teams like Phoenix (if needed)

#   Set up github webhook scripts that will look into each sub-project or microFE when we push our code.
    If any changes are made, then we will start a process that will make a production version of that microFE app with webpack

#   Once production build is done, we can upload all our files to Amazon S3

Each microFE step should be independent. So if microFE A is changed only, then only its production build is done and uploaded to S3. Others should be affected because of that
One can be deployed without others being deployed.

Amazon S3 will have the built version of all our different sub-projects/microFEs.

When a file request is made, the file is not served directly from S3, instead it will make a request to Amazon CloudFront (basically a CDN)
Basically Amazon CloudFront will see the incoming request and figure out which files to pull out of our S3 bucket and serve it back to the browser.
